    <p>This is the planet on which we live on.Earth is the third planet from the sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. It is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. Earth takes about 365.256 days to revolve around the sun which is and earth year.

    A thin layer of gases called the atmosphere envelops the earth. Ninety-Nine percent of the Earth’s atmosphere is made up of nitrogen and oxygen, and remaining 1% contains other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide, and water  vapor.Earth, like most other Solar System bodies formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas of the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of almost 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted Earth's environment.
    <br>
    <br>
    Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate, soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable, threatening people's lives and causing widespread extinction of other life.Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.</p>
