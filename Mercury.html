    <p>Mercury is both the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the sun. It can be seen from Earth near the horizon at dawn or dusk and can easily be mistaken for a distant star. Not much larger than Earth’s moon, Mercury completes its orbit in about 88 Earth days. The planet is not always visible to us as it is very close the sun and is generally hidden in the sun’s glare. However, it can be seen as a bright spot of light during sunrise and sunset at a particular time of a year. Mercury can be seen just before sunrise in the months of September and October and just after the sunset in March and April.

     Mercury has no satellites.Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.[30][31] The planet's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's density of 5.515 g/cm3.[3] If the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out from both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser than those of Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3.[32] Mercury's density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.

     Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous than the surface of Mars or the Moon, both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology, such as maria and plateaus.[50] Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity, which include impact craters, the resulting ejecta, and ray systems. Larger albedo features correspond to higher reflectivity plains.</p>
