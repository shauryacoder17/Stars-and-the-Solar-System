    <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, is the second-largest planet in our solar system by mass and size and the
      most distant planet easily visible to the unaided eye from Earth. This gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and
      helium is easily recognized by its yellowish color, magnificent rings, and oblate—or flattened at the
      poles.Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds).
      Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid
      helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper
      atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary
      magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to
      Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[28] The outer
      atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on
      Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on Neptune.[29]

      The planet's most notable feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a
      smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 83 moons[30] are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are
      officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and
      the second largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only
      moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.</p>
