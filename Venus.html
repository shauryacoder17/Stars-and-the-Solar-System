      The planet is the brightest object in the night sky after the moon.Venus, the second planet from the sun, is the closest planet to Earth and one of the brightest objects we see in the sky. It is sometimes referred to as Earth's 'sister planet' because of their similar size, mass, composition, and proximity to the sun. It spins slowly in the opposite direction than most planets. It takes 243 earth days to rotate on its own axis and 225 days to revolve around the sun. Venus is thus, sometimes referred to as the both morning and the evening star.
      <br>

      Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days,[24] but rotates around its axis in 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east. This retrograde rotation creates a synodic day of only 117 Earth days.[25] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.

      Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen—both exist as supercritical fluids at the planet's surface—and traces of other gases including sulfur dioxide.[30] The mass of its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at Earth's—a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1 km (5⁄8 mi) under Earth's oceans. The density at the surface is 65 kg/m3 (4.1 lb/cu ft), 6.5% that of water or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at 293 K (20 °C; 68 °F) at sea level.

      <br>
      The CO2-rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least 735 K (462 °C; 864 °F).[24][31] This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) and maximum surface temperature of 700 K (427 °C; 801 °F),[32][33] even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance. Because of its runaway greenhouse effect, Venus has been identified by scientists such as Carl Sagan as a warning and research object linked to climate change on Earth.
